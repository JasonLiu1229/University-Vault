## Assignment 3  
  
See [User-stories.pdf](User-stories.pdf)  
How do our User-stories hold up to the INVEST criteria:     
I. Stories should be **independent** of another and should not have dependencies on other stories:    
	- The 3 user-stories are not dependent on each-other so the first criteria is fulfilled
N. **Negotiable**: Too much detail on story limits conversation with the customer     
	- The user-stories abide by the what and why without the how which makes it negotiable with the customer, the second criteria is also fulfilled
V. Each story has to be of **value** to the customer     
	- The user-stories are all important parts of the project so their are of high value to the customer, the third criteria is also fulfilled
E. Stories should be small enough to **estimate**     
	- The stories are divided up in small manageable pieces which make it estimable, the fourth criteria is fulfilled
S. **Stories** should be small enough to be completed in one iteration     
	- The stories also been broken down into smaller manageable units of work which makes it easier to plan, estimate and efficiently develop it, the fifth criteria is fulfilled 
T. **Testable**: Acceptance criteria should be available     
	- The stories are clearly written and have clear conditions of satisfaction which makes it easier to know what needs to be tested and how, the sixth criteria is fulfilled

## Assignment 4  
  
Come up with seven or more interesting questions that the developers can ask the customer.  
  
1. How will the payment be done? Is it done through the platform or through a third party? If it is third party, what  
   options do you have in mind?  
2. How is the current IT-infrastructure built? (detailed if possible) Are there any specific requirements for  
   integration with existing university systems or third-party tools, such as learning management systems?  
3. How will students and professors synchronize their lecture schedules with digital calendars, and which calendar  
   platforms will be supported?  
4. Are there any specific accessibility requirements, such as support for differently-abled students, that the platform  
   needs to adhere to? (for example: adding text to speech for blind students or colorblind mode for colorblind people)  
5. What are the preferred video file formats and is there a minimum/maximum fps preffered?  
6. Can you elaborate on the user roles and permissions for administrative aids, (assistant) professors, and students,  
   including what actions they can perform within the platform?  
7. How will the platform facilitate communication and collaboration among professors, assistants, and students,  
   especially outside of lectures?  
8. Elaborate on how you want to integrate the mobile app on the smartwatch?  
9. Does the university have its own servers or is a online hosting service used for this purpose?  
10. Elaborate more on specific types/formats of statistical reports that the university wants (for example: how is the  
    workload represented, etc.)?  
11. How flexible should the platform be in terms of allowing the IT department to add new report types easily?
