New chapter, starting from bipartite matching algorithms
# The graph matching problem 
## Basic definitions
Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph and $M \subseteq E$ be a subset of the edges of G.

We call M a **matching** of G if all edges e in M are vertex disjoint. The vertices incident to M are referred to as matched vertices, whereas the remaining vertices are termed unmatched. A matching M is said to be maximum if for all other matching M' we have $|M| \ge |M'|$.
